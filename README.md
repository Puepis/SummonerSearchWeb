# Summoner Search

[Summoner Search]( http://Puepis.github.io/lolsearcher) is a basic web application that uses the Riot Games API to
retrieve and display summoner information.

## Prerequisites
To use the application, you will need to use your own Riot Games API Key and add it to the key.js file.

`Note: API keys expire every 24 hours`

## Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
Currently I am trying to set up a proxy to avoid CORS "issues" that prevent data from being retrieved from the Riot Games server. The **temporary** solution to this problem is to install an extension on your browser (like [CORS Everywhere](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/cors-everywhere/)) that enables CORS.
